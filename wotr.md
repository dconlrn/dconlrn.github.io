This section is going to be deleted and reorganized later:
Notes and objective to be organized: 

Taking over enemy cities and strongholds earns you victory points.
Shadow people need 10 victory points to win
Free people only need 4 victory points to win
Get Frodo and Sam to mount doom
If the ring bearers make it to mount doom the free people win the game regardless of how many points each player has.
As the fellowship moves through middle earth their progress and corruption is counted on the fellowship track.
If the corruption reaches the end of the fellowship track then the shadow players win the game.
