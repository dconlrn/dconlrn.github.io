- 4 for the free people
- 7 for the shadow

## Basics

- You play a series of turns until one side has won the game
- Each turn consists of 6 phases
- Action dice largely determine what you are able to do in the game
> *This is in relation to the Action Resolution phase. Discussed later.*

*As the fellowship moves through middle earth their progress and corruption is counted on the fellowship track.*

**How can you win ?**

*Acquire victory points by taking over enemy cities and strongholds.*

Free People:

- Acquire 4 victory Points
- Ring bearers make it to mount doom.
- Get Frodo and Sam to mount doom

Shadow People:

- Acquire 10 victory points
- Free peoples corruption on the fellowship track reaches 10 


#### Phases

- **1.** Phase One (Recover Action Dice / Draw Event Cards)

> - You recover your spent action dice and draw event cards, on the first turn there are no dice to recover so ignore it only for the first turn. 
> - Draw one card from each of your event decks



- **2.** Phase Two (Fellowship Phase)
- **3.** Phase Three (Hunt Allocation)
- **4.** Phase Four (Action Roll)
> Roll the dice !
- For the shadow players, every eye you roll is immediately placed into the hunt box.


<a id="phase-five"></a>


- **5.** Phase Five (Action Resolution)
- This phase is largely what is considered to be the actual game.
- Starting with the free peoples side:
> Each player will alternate using one of their dice to take an action.

<img src="https://imgur.com/L7x18WZ.png">

> If you have fewer dice then the other player you can choose to not take an action and pass.
> As long as one player/team has less dice they can continue to choose to pass but as soon as both players/teams have the same amount of dice the passing option is no longer available and you have to take an action.

> Alternatively if one player/team runs out of dice first the other player/team can take action after action untill they run out.

**So what can you do ? What kind of action can you take**

<a id="palantir-dice"></a>

*As you can see each sets of die has several icons on them and while they look a little different between boths sets of dice the actions they represent are largely the same.*



**Palantir Dice**

<img src="https://imgur.com/UqsUITW.png">

- Use the palantir to play any one of the event cards top side effects.
- You could also use a palantir to draw one card from either event deck.

*Note: There is a hand limit of only 6 cards. You **must** immediately discard cards if you exceed that number. Always discard cards face down.* 

**IF EITHER DECK RUNS OUT OF CARDS DO NOT SHUFFLE THE DISCARD PILE BACK IN THAT DECK IS SIMPLY DEPLETED**

<img src="https://imgur.com/6WMb1Fw.png">

**Playing a card**

- Sometimes the card will have prerequisites in bold.
- If you can play the card however, follow its instructions and then discards the card face down.
- If the card says **Play on the table** it means the cards effects are on going.
> Leave the card on the table untill it is discarded. The trigger for which will be described on the card. 

- The bottom side is used during combat.

<a id="army-symbol"></a>

**The Army Symbol Dice**

<img src="https://imgur.com/120YBee.png">

*Note: The shadow players have a die face dedicated to this action, however the free people only have the combined muster/army side*

When you take an army action you have 3 options:

- *1.* Play an event card with the army symbol on it.

<img src="https://imgur.com/xuUFKjg.png">

- *2.* Move up to two different armies to free adjacent regions.

<img src="https://imgur.com/5Kzwrc7.png">


- *3.* Make one of your armies attack an adjacent enemy army.

<a id="muster-dice"></a>

**The Muster Dice**

<img src="https://imgur.com/ciNwOXr.png">

- Play a Muster card

<img src="https://imgur.com/4I38biA.png">

- Can also be used to make a dipolomatic action.

> This means going over to the political track and moving one nation one step closer to being at war.

<img src="https://imgur.com/5jhIyXo.png">

> - A nation could not move to the war tile until it is activated.
> - Once a nation is at war they can use the muster die to recruit units.
> > Looking at the map you will notice a bunch of little diamonds.

<img src="https://imgur.com/p39jMRF.png">

- These Diamonds are settlements
> - Recruit units (Place recruitment pieces on the board) here if:
> > - You can control them
> > - They are not being seiged

*Event cards can allow you to break these rules*

<img src="https://imgur.com/g2JFzCp.png">

When using the muster to recruit you can choose to:

- Take one elite piece
- Or two other units regular and or leader from your reinforcements and put them into play (Place them on the board).

<img src="https://imgur.com/EOHYbud.png">


- If you recruit two units they must be placed into different settlements.
- You can recruit in settlements of two different nations as long as they are both at war.
> > Make sure the corresponding units are used for each place.
> > - ie. Dwarves cant go in Rivendell

- Nasgul are considered sauron leaders they can only be recruited in a sauron stronghold.

Lastly:

**For the shadow only!**

- You can Use a muster to bring one of your characters into play
- As long as the prerequisites on their cards are satisfied.
- Bringing them into play allows you to roll an additional die at the beginning of the turn.
> > You have three minions
> > - Saurman
> > - The Mouth of Sauron
> > - The Witch-King (Both a character and a Nasgul)
