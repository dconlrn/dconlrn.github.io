> Each companion has a card associated with them
- Take the Gandalf the Grey card and place it face up on top of the deck.

- 4 for the free people
- 7 for the shadow

## Basics

- You play a series of turns until one side has won the game
- Each turn consists of 6 phases
- Action dice largely determine what you are able to do in the game
> *This is in relation to the Action Resolution phase. Discussed later.*

*As the fellowship moves through middle earth their progress and corruption is counted on the fellowship track.*

**How can you win ?**

*Acquire victory points by taking over enemy cities and strongholds.*

Free People:

- Acquire 4 victory Points
- Ring bearers make it to mount doom.
- Get Frodo and Sam to mount doom

Shadow People:

- Acquire 10 victory points
- Free peoples corruption on the fellowship track reaches 10 


#### Phases

- **1.** Recover Action Dice / Draw Event Cards

> - You recover your spent action dice and draw event cards, on the first turn there are no dice to recover so ignore it only for the first turn. 
> - Draw one card from each of your event decks



- **2.** Fellowship Phase
- **3.** Hunt Allocation
- **4.** Action Roll
> Roll the dice !
- For the shadow players, every eye you roll is immediately placed into the hunt box.

- **5.** Action Resolution
- This phase is largely what is considered to be the actual game.
- Starting with the free peoples side:
> Each player will alternate using one of their dice to take an action.

> If you have fewer dice then the other player you can choose to not take an action and pass.
> As long as one player/team has less dice they can continue to choose to pass but as soon as both players/teams have the same amount of dice the passing option is no longer available and you have to take an action.

> Alternatively if one player/team runs out of dice first the other player/team can take action after action untill they run out.

**So what can you do ? What kind of action can you take**

*As you can see each sets of die has several icons on them and while they look a little different between boths sets of dice the actions they represent are largely the same.*

**Palantir**

- Use the palantir to play any one of the event cards top side effects.
- You could also use a palantir to draw one card from either event deck.

*Note: There is a hand limit of only 6 cards. You **must** immediately discard cards if you exceed that number. Always discard cards face down.* 

**IF EITHER DECK RUNS OUT OF CARDS DO NOT SHUFFLE THE DISCARD PILE BACK IN THAT DECK IS SIMPLY DEPLETED**

**Playing a card**

- Sometimes the card will have prerequisites in bold.
- If you can play the card however, follow its instructions and then discards the card face down.
- If the card says **Play on the table** it means the cards effects are on going.
> Leave the card on the table untill it is discarded. The trigger for which will be described on the card. 

- The bottom side is used during combat.

**The army symbol**

*Note: The shadow players have a die face dedicated to this action, however the free people only have the combined muster/army side*

When you take an army action you have 3 options:

- *1.* Play an event card with the army symbol on it.

- *2.* Move up to two different armies to free adjacent regions.

- *3.* Make one of your armies attack an adjacent enemy army.
