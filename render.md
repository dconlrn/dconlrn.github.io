# Render

### Prelim Notes:


Likely the best way to learn Render

[The Actual Documentation](https://renderpartners.freshdesk.com/support/home)


On a typical project there are two Exegetes.

A direct link to download render:

When you open the render program this is what you see.

The reason your viewing it like this is because in terms of the training they wanted you to see all this stuff so you could then delete it and make it look like this again.

Normally if you were starting a fresh render session you would just see the configure button and the bottom left projects button that looks like a box, the bottom right sync button, and the top right 3 dots button next to the logout button.


If you were to click on the configure button. This weird box would pop up.

This box with all the dots is really just a password box.
If you click on the dots they will highlight.
A specific sequence of selected "dot boxes" corresponds to a password that gets created, which anyone could create, when you first run render.
This is something that was not explained.


Once you enter the correct password, if there is one, youll get the configure menu.

## How to structure the slides

You need to do something similar to the obt slides.
The render website has all of the roles listed and definitions of the roles.
