When you open the render program this is what you see.

The reason your viewing it like this is because in terms of the training they wanted you to see all this stuff so you could then delete it and make it look like this again.

Normally if you were starting a fresh render session you would just see the configure button and the bottom left projects button that looks like a box, the bottom right sync button, and the top right 3 dots button next to the logout button.
