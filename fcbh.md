## Pre-Notes

Redefine translation in the context of OBT because we can't think of another word to use for reference.

In the context of OBT translation is redefined as converting something from one language to another language in either text or audio form.

How can we understand the subject matter:

1. SME: Subject Matter Expert
2. Study the hell out of the document as if we were students.

*The second part is hard because we dont know the subject matter we have not mastered it.*

- Develop orthography: skip
- Preparatory training: possibly skipping also

## Draft LOOP

(*Essentially, this is where "translation" begins*)

*The point of the draft loop is understanding the scripture you want to translate, internalizing it and finally translating-recording it.*


**The Team!**

*There can be multiple teams with the following format*


(*Note: Two sets of the following teams:*)


**Generally the person/people that do this are called:**

> - (TA) Translation Advisor(s) aka an "Exegete"
> > - Typically one person 
> > - Needs to be literate
> - (MTT) Mother Tongue Translator(s)
> > - Minimum of two MTT's
> > - Can be illiterate



*Consists of 3 parts.*

- **BEGIN LOOP:**

> - Exegesis (A): interpreting the Bible correctly. Using software like Paratext and Logos/Translator's Workplace,study a passage and collect what you learn in documents we have titles "Book Notes" and "Set Notes". This information is communicated to the team through conversation.
> > - Maybe pictures of what this looks like or screenshots of the worksheets or the software.
>
> - Internalization (B): know the story by heart in your own words.
> > Examples:
> > - Videos
> > - Drawing pictures or dramsa ie. Acting it out.
>
> - Draft (C): Where The translation will be recorded in audio/text aka Drafted
> > Examples:
> > - Recording in the target language. (Can put a video of someone recording on a mic)

- **END LOOP (*IF NEED BE GO TO BEGIN*):**

## Peer Review LOOP

*The point of the peer review loop is to obtain input from other people who were not involved in the drafting process/loop. The input relates to things like CANA is it clear is it natural is it acceptable to the audience. First you pay attention to those 3 things and then you worry about the accuracy.*


*Consists of 3 parts and is linked to the [Consultant Check Loop](#ccheck)*

Definitions:

- Peer Review: is the process of reviewing the current state of the drafts.


**The Team!**

*There can be multiple teams with the following format*

**Generally the person/people that do this are called:**

The people who do part A and B of this loop:

> - (MTT) Mother Tongue Translator(s)
> > - Team 1 checks Team 2's work and vice versa

The people who are in charge of part C:

> - Community Checkers
> > - Can be illiterate

- **BEGIN LOOP:**

> - Review Key Terms (A):
> > - Question certain phrases or words. How would this thing be said properly in the target language.
> > Examples:
> > - A screenshot of the Paratext software.
>
> - Peer/Team Check (B):
> > Examples:
> > - Any picture of people looking like they are working.
>
> - Community Testing (C):
> > - Native people reviewing the material and criticing it.
> > - Natives saying things like, we dont say things like this, this doesnt make sense etc..
> > Examples:
> > - Pictures of native looking people reviewing something.

## Back Translation

**DO BEFORE CONSULTANT CHECK LOOP**

*The point of this is to get it ready for the consultant check, so the consultant could hear the final story in the language they understand*

There are 2 options for the backtranslation step, ultimately these are up to the consultant.

1. Retell:
> - Videos Demonstation.
> - Explored in greater detail when you learn Render.

2. Breath pause:
> - Video Demonstation.
> - Explored in greater detail when you learn Render.

> Examples:
> - Illustrations of people who represent the backtranslator and the consultant with like arrows or whatever the hell.

## Consultant Check Loop

*The point of this is that a very educated and trained consultant vouches for this audio as true scripture because it ends up being faithful to the original message. If not the consultant sends it back for revisions (The peer review loop).*

*Consists of 2 parts and is linked to the [Peer Review Loop](#peer)*




- **BEGIN LOOP:**

> - Consultant Check (A):
> > Examples:
> > - Illustration of people. A person that represents a consultant.
>
> - Test and Revise (B):
> > Examples:
> > - Evaluate generally overtime whether communites are using the audio bibles or not.
