## What is the deconstructed learning system ?

**In plain english:**

- It's a free to use system that anyone could apply towards learning something.




This is the system.
(Keep in mind this is a process that needs to be written, typed or drawn out and revised till you feel comfortable with the results)

Starting from the most fundamental components of whatever it is you’re trying to learn .

Define the basics:
> This is best done by creating some kind of hierarchy tree where you organize concepts like building blocks.
In the same way that a building will collapse if you remove the first floor from it you need to identify what concept or idea or mechanism is at the base of your hierarchy. This has to be an idea that without understand or grasping fully everything else will fall apart.

Let’s use a car for this example. Personally I don’t know much about cars so this should be fun.

Let’s approach cars as if we wanted to learn about them.

What does a car have meaning what does a car consist of in a common sense kind of way of looking at them.

Well a car has:

A body
Doors
Wheels
Something that makes the car go (an engine)
Something that makes the car stop
A steering wheel
Electronic components
Something that makes the steering wheel work and, for arguments sake we will pretend, we have no clue how.


A car is pretty complicated and there are certainly dozens if not hundreds of more components that make a modern car a car. Right now we don’t really care about those things because we need a place to start that is going to give us a really good base of understanding .

Alright so we have identified some basics when it comes to cars. Let’s think about these basics a little deeper in context of what really makes a car.
If we take an engine out of a car so we still have a car ? Yea we kind of do still have a car because someone or something could push this thing at it could still in someway be driven.
Ok so that means understanding how the engine works is going to have to be something we learn later since without it we still kind of have a car.
What about doors? Without doors do we still have a car ? Yea, sure a doorless car is still a car . Ok doors go on the later list too then.
Electronic components? Cars for decades didn’t have electronic components they were purely mechanical so yea we could put that on the back burner.

What about a steering wheel ? Well we still have a car without a steering wheel but a car that could only go straight forward or straight backwards so this thing is getting closer to being useless. I think we are identifying the idea that steering and a steering wheel should probably be included in a core basic component since after we remove it we’re getting closer to a static thing.


What about wheels ?
Ok without wheels we definitely don’t have a car we basically have like a vessel or an enclosure or something ok so wheels are pretty damn crucial maybe the most crucial component of a car in many ways even though they seem pretty simple but that’s perfect actually because we need simple we need things stripped away so we can build our way up to more complex components or concepts.
