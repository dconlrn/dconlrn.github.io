<h2 align="center"> What is the deconstructed learning system ? </h2>


**In plain english:**

- It's a free to use system that anyone could apply towards learning something.
- It's a system which shows you how to find the core building blocks of whatever it is your trying to learn.

Sometimes applying this system to certain things can be really tricky. Especially things you can't really get a good visual on. Things like computer programming or computer operating systems (Whatever the heck those are).
It would be nice to have someone who is very knowledgable in specific disciplines break things down using DLS.
Thankfully for, things in the computer world at least, I got you covered.

## The System

*(Keep in mind this is a process that needs to be written, typed or drawn out and revised till you feel comfortable with the results)*

We want to try and identify the core thing in whatever it is we are trying to learn ,the **Cornerstone**, that if removed will make the rest of the thing not work or change it into something different.
Lets call this process "**Core Identification.**"


**1. Define The Basics:**


- A body
- Doors
- Wheels
- Something that makes the car go (an engine)
- Something that makes the car stop
- A steering wheel
- Electronic components
- Something that makes the steering wheel work and, for arguments sake we will pretend, we have no clue how.

Core Identification:

**2. Simplify**

Ex.

- A car:
> A car is really just a kind of vehicle with four wheels on a frame and a motor


**3. Unravel The Simplification**

Ask some questions about the different parts of whatever has been simplified in an effort to identify the cornerstone.

- A car: 
> - Is a car still a car without a motor ?
> Answer: Kind of, you might be able to get somewhere by someone pushing you or maybe having a hill.
> - Is a car still a car without wheels on a frame ?
> Answer: No, it's not a car without at least a certain amount of wheels on a frame.


- A thing that takes you from point A to point B



**4. Examine The Simplification**
